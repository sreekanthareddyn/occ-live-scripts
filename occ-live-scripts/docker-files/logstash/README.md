This is the Git repo of the [Docker "Official Image"](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/official_repos/) for [logstash](https://hub.docker.com/_/logstash/) (not to be confused with any official logstash image provided by logstash upstream). See [the Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/_/logstash/) for the full readme on how to use this Docker image and for information regarding contributing and issues.

The [full description from Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/logstash/) is generated over in [docker-library/docs](https://github.com/docker-library/docs), specifically in [docker-library/docs/logstash](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/tree/master/logstash).
